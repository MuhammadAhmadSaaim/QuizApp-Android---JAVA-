# Quiz App

This Quiz App is developed in Java and XML for Android. It is a multiple-choice quiz application that features a set of 25 questions with 4 options each. The app allows users to navigate through the questions, check correct answers, and keeps track of their scores. This is my first Java app, and I have included an APK file for download and testing.

## Features

1. **Question Corpus**: The app contains a corpus of 25 multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Each question has 4 options, and only one correct answer.
   
2. **Navigation**: Users can navigate through the questions using the "Next" and "Prev" buttons on the main screen.

3. **Scoring**:
   - For every correct answer, 5 points are added to the total score.
   - For every incorrect answer, 1 point is deducted from the total score.
   - If a user opts to see the correct answer of a question, 1 point will be deducted from the total score for that question.

4. **Timer**: The app includes a timer that allocates a specific amount of time (in minutes) for the entire quiz. The remaining time is displayed at the top of the screen.

5. **Score and Timer Display**: The app displays the current score and remaining time at the top of the screen throughout the quiz.

6. **Quiz Completion**:
   - The quiz can be completed by either clicking the "End Exam" button or when the timer expires.
   - Upon completion, the total score along with the percentage is displayed at the center of the screen.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Quiz**: Open the app and start the quiz from the main screen.
2. **Answer Questions**: Use the "Next" and "Prev" buttons to navigate through the questions.
3. **View Correct Answers**: If needed, you can view the correct answer for the current question, which will deduct 1 point from your score for that question.
4. **Complete the Quiz**: Finish the quiz by either clicking the "End Exam" button or when the timer runs out.
5. **View Results**: After completing the quiz, your total score and percentage will be displayed.
